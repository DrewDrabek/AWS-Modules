## Notes

- The goal here is to slowly overtime create modules for all of the AWS resources so that I can refer back to them - this is a long term project that will change over time - really the goals here to be able to use this to lab out items

    - TODO:
        - Finish the database services
        - Network services
            - vpc
            - subnets
            - gateways
            - nacls
            - route tables
            - associations
        - Storage services
            - s3
            - ecr


- There will be a DNS module here is as an example for myself - I do not know if I would recommened using this in production. It depends on the enviornment and how comfortable the team is with managing DNS and the records that are required. In the example there are going to be a private and public zone and some examples for the records in there.
